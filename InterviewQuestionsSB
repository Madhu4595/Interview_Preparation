1. What is actuator in spring boot?
Ans: The actuator mainly exposes operational information about the running application â€” health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. 
It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it. 
Once this dependency is on the classpath, several endpoints are available for us out of the box.
