1. What is an API?
==================
=> API Stands for Application Programming Interface, They are basically a collection of functions and procedures which allows us to communicate two application or libray.
=> An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.
=> APIs are all around us. Every time you use a rideshare app, send a mobile payment, or change the thermostat temperature from your phone, you’re using an API.

2. What is REST?
================
=> REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and is an architectural style based on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) for developing web-based applications.
=> REST outlines several guidelines that web services must follow be considered RESTful. These guidelines ensure that requests and resources are sent easily and efficiently between client
and server using standardized HTTP methods.
=> REST is one of the most widely used approaches for building web-based APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). It provides standards between computer systems on the web, 
making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. 
=> REST is more flexible than SOAP and allows applications to exchange data in multiple formats.

3. What is REST API?
=====================
=> RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. 
=> Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. 
=> RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and efficient software communication standards.
=> For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate 
with an internal timesheet application. 

4. Is API considered a software?
================================
=> API is not a software but rather an interface to provide data exchange and functionality among different software applications or processes.
=> While an API provides access to data as well as functionality, it can be thought of as software that fulfills our needs, too.

5. Which protocol do REST APIs use?
===================================
=> REST APIs use the HTTP protocol to communicate with clients.
=> A RESTful API uses existing HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC 2616 protocol, such as:
GET to retrieve a resource;
PUT to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file or block;
POST to create that resource; and
DELETE to remove it.
=> This allows REST APIs to be easily deployed over the internet, since HTTP is the same protocol that is used to deliver web pages to client browsers.

6. Which HTTP request methods are supported by REST ?
=====================================================
=> An HTTP request method indicates which action the client wants the API to perform on a resource.
=> Essential HTTP Methods in RESTful API Development.
1. GET: The GET method is used to ‘retrieve’ a record or a collection of records from the server.
2. POST: The POST method sends data to create a ‘new record‘ on the server. 
3. PUT: The PUT method sends data to update an ‘existing record‘ on the server.
4. PATCH: Like the PUT method, PATCH is also used to send data to update an ‘existing record’ on the server. 
    But the important difference between PUT and PATCH is that PATCH only applies partial modifications to the record instead of replacing the whole record.
5. DELETE: The DELETE method is used to delete record(s) from the server. 

7. What are Advantages and disadvantages of REST API ?
======================================================
Advantages of REST API:
=> REST API is easy to understand and learn, due to its simplicity, known API.
=> With REST API, being able to organize complicated applications & makes it easy to use resources.
=> The high load can be managed with help out of HTTP proxy server & cache.
=> REST API is easy to explore and discover.
=> It makes it simple for new clients to work on other applications, whether it is designed specifically for purpose or not.
=> Use standard HTTP procedure call- outs to retrieve data and requests.
=> REST API depends on codes, can use it to synchronize data with a website without any complications.
=> Users can avail access to the same standard objects and data model when compared to SOAP-based web services.
=> Brings flexibility formats by serializing data in XML or JSON format.
=> Allows Standard-based protection with the use of OAuth protocols to verify your REST requests.

Disadvantages or Challenges in REST:
=> Lack of state: most web applications require stateful mechanisms. 
    Suppose you purchase a website which has a mechanism to have a shopping cart. It is required to know the number of items in the shopping cart before the actual purchase is made. 
    This burden of maintaining the state lies on the client, which makes the client application heavy and difficult to maintain.
=> Last of security: REST doest impose security such as SOAP. That is the reason REST is appropriate for public URLs, but it is not good for confidential data passage between 
    client and server. 

8. What are the principles of REST ?
====================================
1. Client-Server decoupling:
In a REST API design, client and server programs must be independent. 
The client software should only know the URI of the requested resource; it should have no additional interaction with the server application. 

2. Uniform Interface:
All API queries for the same resource should look the same regardless of where they come from. 
The REST API should ensure that similar data, such as a user's name or email address, is assigned to just one uniform resource identifier (URI). 

3. Statelessness:
REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request must contain all the information needed to process it. 

4. Layered System architecture:
REST API requests and responses are routed through many tiers. 
REST APIs must be designed so neither the client nor the server can tell whether they communicate with the final application or an intermediary.  

5. Cacheable:
Wherever feasible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side. 
Server responses must additionally indicate if caching is authorized for the offered assistance. 
The objective is to boost client-side speed while enhancing server-side scalability.  

6. Code on Demand
REST APIs typically provide static resources, but in rare cases, responses may include executable code (such as Java applets). 
In these cases, perform the code when necessary.

9. What is messaging in the context of REST ?
=============================================
=> In REST, messaging refers to the back-and-forth communication between the client and API.
=> An interaction always starts with the client messaging the API with an HTTP request.
=> The API processes this request, then sends back an HTTP response that gives the status of the request and any resources the client asked for.

10. List differences between API and Web Services ?
===================================================
=> All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
=> Web services might not contain all the specifications and can't perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
=> A Web services uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication where as API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
=> A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don't need a network for operation.

11. What is a resource ?
========================
=> In REST, every accessible piece of content on the server is labeled as a resource.
=> A resource is an object with a type, associated data, a relationship with other resources on the server, and a list of methods that can be used with it.
For example, a resource could be an HTML or text file, a data file, an image or video, or an executable code file.
=> A resource is identified with a uniform resource identifier, or URI. Clients access resources by including their URIs in HTTP requests.

12. What is a URI ?
===================
=> URI stands for uniform resource identifier.
=> In REST, a URI is a String that identifies a resource on a web server.
=> Each resource has its own unique URI which, when included in an HTTP request, allows clients to target that resource and perform actions on it.
=> The process of targeting a resource with its URI is called "addressing".
=> The format of a URI is as follows:
    <protocol>://<service-name>/<ResourceType>/<ResourceID>

13. Name the five important principles of an api design ?
=========================================================
1. Consistency:
=> Maintain consistency in naming conventions, URI structures, and response formats throughout the API. 
=> This makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API, as they can apply learned patterns consistently across different endpoints.
2. Clarity and Simplicity:
=> Strive for simplicity and clarity in the design of your API. Use clear and intuitive names for resources, actions, and parameters. 
=> Avoid unnecessary complexity and keep the API design easy to understand for both developers and clients.
3. Versioning:
=> Implement a versioning strategy to handle changes to the API over time. This ensures that existing clients can continue to function without disruption while new features or 
improvements are introduced. Common versioning approaches include including the version number in the URI or using custom headers.
4. Statelessness:
=> Follow the statelessness principle of REST. Each API request from a client to the server should contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. 
Avoid relying on server-side sessions to store client state between requests. This enhances scalability and simplifies client-server interactions.
5. Error Handling:
=> Define clear and consistent error-handling mechanisms. Provide informative error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes. This helps developers understand what went wrong 
and how to correct it. Additionally, include error details in the response payload to aid in troubleshooting.

14. What does it mean for API to be stateless ?
===============================================
=> Statelessness is one of the key principles of REST architecture.
=> In stateless communication, the server does not store any information about previous communications.
=> In other words, the client and server do not know each other's state. Every requests and response is a new interaction, and each request includes everything the server
needs to give a successful response.
=> Statelessness simplifies client-server interactions because the server does not rely on past requests to process future requests.and thus does not need to consume space 
and resources storing data from these requests.

15. Which markup languages are primarily used to represent resources in REST APIs ?
===================================================================================
=> There are 2 common languages for representing resources in REST APIs
    1. XML (extensible markup language)          2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

16. What are Idempotent methods ?
=================================
=> Idemponent methods are methods that return the same outcome irrespective of how many times the same request has been made.
=> These methods are important as there are common instances where the client-side might send out duplicate requests.
=> Hence it's important to use Idemponent methods to avoid such errors.

17. What are the main parts of an HTTP request ?
================================================
There are five main components of an HTTP request in REST.
=> Status line: Indicates the intended action of the request and includes.
=> A request method that indicates the HTTP request method to be performed on the resource.(i.e GET, PUT,POST and DELETE)
=> a URI that identifies the requested resource on the server.
=> The HTTP version being used, which signals which version the API should respond with.
=> HTTP Request Header: Lists metadata about the request, such as the user agent, file formats the client will accept, format of the request body, language, caching preference, etc.
=> HTTP Request Body: Contains any data associated with the request. This is only necessary if the request is to modify data on the server with the POST or PUT methods.

18. State common HTTP response status codes you might see when working with a REST API ?
========================================================================================
1. 1xx informational response - the request was received, continuing process.
    => 100 Continue: Indicates that the initial part of the request has been received and the server will attempt to continue processing the request.
    => 101 Switching Protocols: Indicates that the server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request to switch to a different protocol, such as upgrading to a 
        WebSocket.
    => 102 Processing: This is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request but has not yet completed it. 
        This is typically used in scenarios where processing takes a long time.

2. 2xx successful - the request was successfully received, understood and accepted.
    => 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
    => 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created on the server. The URI of the newly created resource is often provided in the response headers.
    => 204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request, but there is no additional information to send back in the response payload.

3. 3xx redirection - further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
    => 301 Moved Permanently: 
        -> Description: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
        -> Typical Use: Update bookmarks or links to point to the new location.
    => 302 Found:
        -> Description: The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URI.
        -> Typical Use: Similar to 301, but indicates a temporary redirection. The client should continue to use the original URI for future requests.
    => 303 See Other:
        -> Description: The response to the request can be found at a different URI, and the client should retrieve the resource from that URI using a GET method.
        -> Typical Use: Often used for form submissions, where the result is a resource that should be retrieved with a GET request.

4. 4xx client error - the request contains bad syntax or can't be fulfilled.
    => 400 Bad Request: The request was malformed or invalid. The client should review the request and correct any errors.
    => 401 Unauthorized: The client must provide valid authentication credentials to access the requested resource.
    => 403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated, but it does not have permission to access the requested resource.
    => 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
    => 405 Method Not Allowed: The HTTP method used in the request is not allowed for the specified resource.

5. 5xx server error - the server failed to fulfill a valid request.
    => 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that an unexpected condition was encountered on the server. It is a server-side error.
    => 501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is often the case for a feature that is not yet implemented.
    => 502 Bad Gateway: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
    => 503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. It is a temporary condition.
    => 504 Gateway Timeout: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server or some other auxiliary server.

19. What is Authentication ?
============================
=> Authentication is a process of validating credentials like username, password or another secret key to the system and making sure user has been identified in the system correctly.
=> In the API terms Authentication is used to protect the content over web mean only a valid user with valid credentials can access that API endpoint.
=> The different type of authentication mechanism available are Jwt,oAuth and Basic Authentication etc.

20. How does HTTP Basic Authentication work ? 
=============================================
=> While implementing Basic Authentication as part of APIs, that user must provide the username and password which is then concatenated by the browser in the form of "username:password"
    and then perform base64 encoding on it.
=> The encoded value is then sent as the value for the "Authorization" header on every HTTP request from the browser.
=> Since the credentials are only encoded, it's advised to use this form when requests are sent over HTTPS as they are not secure and can be intercepted by anyone 
    if secure protocols are not used.

21. What is caching ?
=====================
=> Caching is the method of temporarity storing a copy of a server response in a location (like computer memory) in order to retrieve it more quickly in the future.
=> When working with REST APIs, Caching improves server perfomance by reducing the work the server has to do to fulfill the request.
=> Caching also makes applications that use the API run faster since they  don't need to send a new request every time they need a resource.
=> Cache duration of a resource (i.e how long the resource can be cached by the client before the resource is retrived again) is specified in the HTTP response header with the 
    Cache-Control field.

22. What is Payload ?
=====================
=> In the context of a REST API, the term "payload" refers to the data that is transmitted in the body of a request or response. 
=> The payload carries the actual information being sent, such as parameters, JSON or XML data, or other content relevant to the API operation.

23. What is the difference between REST and SOAP ?
==================================================
=> SOAP is a strict protocol for building secure APIs. REST is not a protocol - it is an architectural style dictated by a set of guidelines.
=> REST APIs are simpler to build, more lightweight and generally faster than SOAP APIs.
=> SOAP APIs are considered more secure than REST APIs, through REST APIs can still implement safety features to make them reasonably secure.
=> REST allows caching of responses, whereas SOAP does not.
=> SOAP encodes data in XML format. REST allows you to encode data in any format, through XML and JSON are more popular.

24. What is the difference between REST and AJAX ?
==================================================
=> Asynchronous JavaScript, or AJAX is a set of web development techniques used in web applications. At it's core, AJAX allows a web page to make requests to a server and update the
    page interface without needing to refresh.
=> An AJAX client might utilize REST APIs with its requests to a server and update the page interface without needing to refresh.
=> REST APIs can communicate with any client, whether the client uses AJAX or not.
=> Also, unlike REST which uses HTTP requests and responses for messaging, AJAX sends its requests to the server with the XMLHttpRequest object that is built into Javascript.
    Server responses are executed by the pages JavaScript code to alter the page context.

25. List Tools used for testing APIs ?
======================================
=> There are many software tools designed for testing RESTful APIs: Postman, JMeter and Katalon Studio.

26. How to secure REST APIs ?
=============================
REST APIs do not employ as strict security measures as SOAP APIs, therefore should not be used to send or retrieve sensitive information.
However, good REST APIs still implement safety measures for secure and reliable data transfers.
    => Use HTTPs(SSL/TLS)
    => Authentication and Authorization
    => Encryption
    => Rate-limiting
    => No sensitive information in URIs
    => Token-based Authentication
    => Secure Password Handling
    => OAuth 2.0 for Authorization
    => Input validation
    => Security Headers
    => Educate Developers

27. What are some main characterstics of REST ?
===============================================
=> REST uses the HTTP protocol for communication.
=> REST makes server resources available via URIs. Each resource has a unique URI.
=> REST is stateless, meaning the server does not store information about past communications with clients.
=> REST uses GET to retrieve resources from a server, whereas other web service methods use POST.

28. What is the difference between API testing and Unit Testing ?
=================================================================
=> Unit testing is white-box testing while API testing is black-box testing.
=> Unit testing is used to verify that each unit in isolation works as expected while API testing is used to assure full functionality of the system.

29. How should we test the API security ?
=========================================
To test the security of the API during API testing, we need to validate two components.
=> Authentication : Whether the identity of the end-user is correct.
=> Authorization : Whether the user is allowed to access the access.

30. Which options help to identify the type of API requests ?
=============================================================
=> The HTTP Methods help identify the type of API requests.

31. What are the challenges faced in API testing ?
==================================================
The challenges faced in API testing are:
=> API chaining or sequencing the API class.
=> Testing parameter combinations.
=> Frequent Schema changes.
=> Access to the database.

32. What must be checked when performing API testing ?
======================================================
In order to perform an API test you must check the following.
=> Accuracy of data
=> Schema validation
=> HTTP status codes
=> Data type, validations, order and completeness
=> Authorization checks
=> Implementation of response timeout
=> Error codes in case API returns
=> Non-functional testing like performance and security testing

33. What kinds of bugs does API testing find most commonly ?
=============================================================
The types of bugs that APIs will find are:
=> Missing or duplicate functionality
=> Fails to handle error conditions gracefully
=> Stress
=> Reliability
=> Security
=> Unused flags
=> Not implemented errors 
=> Inconsistent error handling 
=> Performance
=> Multi-threading issues
=> Improper errors

34. What are 'Options' in REST APIs ?
=====================================
=> It's an HTTP method used to fetch the supported HTTP options or operations that help clients to choose the options in REST APIs.
=> Cross-Origin Resources Sharing (CORS) uses the REST option method.

35. What are common API errors that often founded ?
===================================================
=> HTTP Status codes (Client Erros, Server Erros)
=> Validation Errors
=> Authentication and Authorization Errors 
=> Rate Limit Exceeded
=> Conflict Errors
=> Unexpected Erros
=> Custom Error Messages
=> Redirect and URL Changes

36. What are API documentation templates that are commonly used ?
=================================================================
There are several available API documentation templates help to make the entire process simple and straightforward, such as: Swagger, Miredot and Slate etc.
