1. What are Microservices ?
=> Microservices is an architecture where the application is exposed as loosely coupled service that can be independently developed, deployed and maintained.
=> Each service exposed is referred to as Microservice. Each service performs a unique function.
=> Speciality of this architecture is that polyglot architecture is supported. 
=> For example, if a team is working on one of the microservice using Java, SpringBoot and MySQL another team can work on another microservice using Python, Node JS and NoSQL.
=> Different microservices can use a different version of the same programming language.
=> Different microservices can use different programming languages.
=> Different microservices can use different architectures as well.

2. Why Microservices ?
=> In case of monolithic applications, there several problems like
    => same code base for presentation, business layer and data access layer. Application is deployed as a single unit.
    => Complex to maintain and scalability is an issue.
=> Microservice solves the above problem.
=> Microservice are ideal when a monolithic or a legacy application needs to be modernized.
=> For new software development, if the key business drivers are to reduce time to market, scalable better software, lower costs, faster development or clound native development.
=> Each service is independent and gives the flexibility to choose the programming language, database, and architecture.
=> Distinct services can be developed, deployed and maintained independently.

3. When to use Microservice ?
=> Reduce time to market.
=> Scalable better software.
=> Lower casts.
=> Faster development.
=> Clound-native development.

4. What are the main features of Microservices ?
=> Microservices architecture breaks an application into smaller services, and it is possible to develop, deploy each service independently.
   This makes the introduction of new features in an application very easier.
=> Decentralization : Microservices architecture leads to distributed systems. The data management is decentralized. There will be a monolithic database containing all data beloging to 
   the application. Each service has the ownership of the data related to the business functionality of that service.
=> Black Box : Every microservice is defined as a black box. The details of the complexity are hidden from other service / components.
=> Security : The Microservice platform itself should private capabilities for certificate management. different type of credentials, authentication and authentication based on RBAC
(Role Based Access Model). Security is decoupled from the microservice development team as platform standartatization help with it.
